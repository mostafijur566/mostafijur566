# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mostafijur Rahman, an app developer who is passionate about programming and using technology to create innovative solutions. I specialize in developing cross-platform apps using Flutter and building powerful backend systems using Django and Django Rest Framework.

## My Skills

- **Flutter**: I have extensive experience using Flutter to build beautiful and functional mobile apps for a wide range of clients and industries. I'm familiar with many of the key Flutter packages, including Provider, Bloc, and Dio, and I'm always learning new tricks and techniques to make my apps even better.
- **Django and Django Rest Framework**: I'm skilled in using Django and Django Rest Framework to build powerful and scalable backend systems for web and mobile apps. I've used these technologies for a wide range of features, including user authentication, API development, and database management.
- **UI/UX Design**: I understand the importance of creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for mobile and web apps. I have a background in UI/UX design, and I use that expertise to create apps that not only look great, but also provide an exceptional user experience.
- **Firebase**: I'm also familiar with Firebase, a powerful backend platform for building web and mobile apps. I've used Firebase for a wide range of features, including user authentication, real-time databases, and cloud functions.

## My Projects

- **Store Management App**: A multi-platform app for MRF Trading Company to manage their store inventory, sales, and customer data. Built using Flutter and Django Rest Framework, the app can be run on iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, and Windows devices, and provides a user-friendly interface for employees to track store performance and make data-driven decisions.
